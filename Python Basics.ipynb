What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","-  Python is a programing language  known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility also  used to tell computers what to do.\n","\n"," Python is popular -\n"," - Widely used in the industry\n"," - Easy to Learn & Read\n"," - Vast Libraries & Frameworks\n"," - Strong Community Support\n"," -Used for many things – like websites, apps, data, games, and AI\n","\n","2.   What is an interpreter in Python?\n","\n","  An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. It converts high-level Python code into machine-readable instructions at runtime, allowing you to run your code without compiling it first.\n","\n","\n","3.   What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n"," Keyword are perdefined word that hold a specail meaning and have specific purpose on python programing\n","\n"," Python Keywords:\n","- if, else, elif – for conditional statements\n","- for, while, break, continue – for loops\n","- def, return – for functions\n","- class – for defining classes\n","- import, from, as – for importing modules\n","- True, False, None – special constants\n","- and, or, not, in, is – logical operators\n","\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","  \n","  No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n","\n","5. What is mutability in Python\n","\n","  In Python, mutability refers to an object's ability to be changed after it is created. If an object is mutable, its contents can be modified without changing its identity. Common mutable types include lists, dictionaries, and sets.\n","\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","\n","  LLists are mutable because they are made to store data that can change. You can add, remove, or change items in a list.\n","\n","  Tuples are immutable because they are meant to store data that should not change. Once created, you cannot change the items in a tuple.\n","\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","In Python, == is the equality operator that checks whether two variables have the same value. It compares the contents of the variables.\n","\n","The is operator is the identity operator that checks whether two variables refer to the same object in memory. It compares the object identities, not their values.\n","\n","8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements and return True or False based on logic.\n","\n","9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Type casting in Python means converting one data type into another.\n","\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","  \n","  In Python, implicit type casting happens automatically when Python changes one data type to another during a calculation. For example, if you add an integer and a float, Python changes the integer to a float by itself. Explicit type casting is when you manually change the type using functions like int(), float(), or str(). For example, you can turn the string \"10\" into the number 10 using int(\"10\"). Implicit casting is done by Python, while explicit casting is done by the programmer.\n","\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow a program to make decisions and perform different actions based on certain conditions. They help control the flow of the program by executing specific blocks of code only when certain conditions are true.\n","\n","12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","The elif statement short for else if and it's used to check multiple conditions in a sequence after an if condition.\n","\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?\n","\n","- for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to repeat a block of code (e.g., looping through a list or a range).\n","\n","- while loop is used when you don’t know exactly how many times to loop — it runs as long as a condition is true.\n","\n","- for loops work with sequences, while while loops depend on a condition.\n","\n","- In while loops, you must manually update variables to avoid infinite loops.\n","\n","14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop ?\n","\n","A while loop is more suitable in scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that changes dynamically during execution.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"B7QBiNaavWt9"}}]}
